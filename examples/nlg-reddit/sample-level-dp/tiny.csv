"I am very bias when it comes to this Iron Hill location. First off, over the last year their bartenders have helped me learn what kinds of beers I di and do not like.They have gotten to know me and I them. It's borderline, my Cheers. In addition to beer, they do make good cocktails, but it's rare I get cocktails there.   I'd say if you can get there for happy hour that's your best time to go. They have a nice selection of appetizers for $5 and $7 and drink specials as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I frequent this location when I visit my mom.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The food is always good.  I love the corn cake, you don't get that everywhere.  I read a review that was offended by the statue of a monkey at the checkout desk.  That monkey has always been here and makes me chuckle every time.  If you have a sense of humor then it isn't offensive.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"We love a good home made pasta dinner at home , this time we decided to try La casa pasta. You're greeted by the new owners Franco and Mara ( Franco e Mara son√≥ maravigliosi coppia italiana).The aroma and taste of fresh basil, tomatoes and good olive oil on the bruschetta gustoso , the lobster raviolis A+,  Mussels and conch over pasta was well prepared, the red sauce over spaghetti and meatballs was great. Fresh made dessert we had tiramisu,chocolate cake and cookies. We where in the right place and the right time! We can't wait to try the rest of the menu.

"I came in for happy hour and was one of the first customers in the door. I took a corner seat at the bar. The atmosphere was upscale but didn't feel stuffy. As the employees bustled around preparing for dinner service, I studied the cocktail menus (HH along with their standard drinks). Feeling slightly overwhelmed by what was in front of me I tried asking the bartender what drinks are popular/her favorite. I got a very vague explanation about the menu where she stated that all of the drinks were popular. This was not helping me to narrow down my search. I stared blankly at the menu for another five minutes and finally caught the attention of the other bartender who came over and was more than willing to explain everything cocktail on the menu to me in detail (trust me, I felt bad holding him up for that long, but I was very grateful). I narrowed my drink choices down and decided to get the 'Planet Caravan' as my first choice. It was a bourbon drink but perfect for me, as I am a new bourbon drinker. It was light and refreshing with just a tad of bourbon bite to it. I ordered a few dishes off the HH menu (today's toast, which was a red pepper spread topped with a chickpea salad and olives, and the maitake steak wit). I was very impressed with the food. The bread for both was very soft and I truly enjoyed my maitake cheese steak with a rutabaga based 'cheese' sauce.  For dessert I decided on another drink, even though the sticky toffee pudding was calling to me. I ordered the 'Apple Scruffs' which was wonderful. It was very festive and had a cinnamon/apple flavor with just a touch of citrus, giving my mouth a refreshed feeling. I overheard the bartender who had originally let me down with her drink explanation telling another guest that she had only started a week ago. So it's understandable to an extent that she was slightly awkward, but also shows a lack of training. When the other bartender was explaining the drinks to me, I hope she was listening carefully so that she will not have so much difficulty next time. Therefore, I give four stars to this review. The food and drinks here are lovely, but hopefully the rest of the staff are well versed in the menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"We had a great breakfast here. The main reason why I'm submitting a positive review is that I left my phone there, and they held on to it all day for me. Always nice to know you can depend on the kindness of strangers!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Santa Barbara for a super low key bacholorette for me! Which meant a lot of eating, wine, walking round, and more eating! First stop was Tupelo though! And after the slightly long drive from LA, we were all definitely hungry and ready to eat!  A little bit of a wait since we didn't want to sit outside. Got a cute little seat inside after maybe 10-15 minutes. The place itself is very cute! Big blocky wooden chairs and a natural clay colored floor, with the brick and tan interior, and the black metal fencing, makes it feel like you're sitting in a courtyard somewhere. Sans plants and sunshine shining from above.   It just so happened that we all wanted the dungeness crab cakes, so we didn't have a lot of variety, but here's what I got to try.  BEIGNETS The beignets I've had before were light fluffy little balls of goodness, while these had the same shape I'd say they were so dense that I could barely eat one. They were extremely deep fried too which made the outside kinda hard. The sauce that came with it was delic...but of course if the beignet doesn't work...  DUNGENESS CRAB CAKE Yummy! If you eat a lot, then this definitely isn't the dish for you, but for a small girl this is just right. Plenty of crab in here and the hash is good too. Good balance of flavors.   Small lunch to get ready to explore the rest of SB and make sure there's room in our tummies for more goodness! Good place to stop by for brunch!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
Not impressed when you walk past me and don't say hello.  They did nothing to acknowledge us and it still took 5 minutes to get a menu.  The fried rice tasted was not good and my sushi was not deep fried and it wasn't hot.  I would go on but this getting to be drag just like the restaurant.  Maybe they were having an off day every does every now and again.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Quite possibly my favorite beers right here.  My favorite beer so far was the Tres, the aged Imperial Stout in old whisky barrels.  So much flavor!!     To top off all the beer, make sure to come on thursday when the Twisted Tandoor is parked at Dragoon.    Looking forward to them growing their business.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0
"I had an awesome experience at this shop. Everyone i spoke with was incredibly nice and helpful. They are very thorough, and focus quite a lot on longevity. They were very honest when talking about sizes and font, and wanted to make sure I made a good decision that would make for a great long lasting (and legible) tattoo. The artist, Race, was super sweet and made me feel very comfortable. I would definitely go back, and highly recommend them to everyone!",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0
